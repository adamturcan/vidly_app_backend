This project is a client/server web app build in react.js/node.js. Purpose of this project was for me to test and learn React and Node.

This is a server side part of my app, which was created with node.js

to make this whole app work you will need also the "vidly_app_client" part

after cloning this repo. download all needed packages using "npm i" command when done,you need to set an env variable "genres_jwtPrivateKey" to any password(used for security purposes)
when done, you will have to have installed mongo db in your computer and set env variable "db" to a port your database is running at
to start the app run "node index.js"


if you would like to preview or test my app without cloning repo you can easily check it out on my heroku link:

//link will be added soon
